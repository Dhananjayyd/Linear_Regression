# Linear_Regression

>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the response or target variable) and one or more >independent variables (also called the predictors or explanatory variables) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
>
>The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data, which can be used to make predictions or to understand the relationship between the >variables. The line is typically represented as:
>
>y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + ... + bn * xn
>
>where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, b0 is the intercept, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients that determine the slope >of the line.
>
>Linear regression can be used for both simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable, and multiple linear regression, where there are two or >more independent variables.

## Example Of Linear Regression

>Suppose we want to model the relationship between a person's weight (dependent variable) and their height (independent variable). We have collected data from 50 >individuals and their weights and heights are recorded in a dataset.
>
>First, we would plot the data to see if there is a linear relationship between the variables. Here's what the plot might look like:
